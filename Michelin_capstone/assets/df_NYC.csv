This meal begins with a playful platter of bites (envision smoked ham katsu) to break the ice and stimulate the palate for the kitchen's sparkling sashimi. Slices of Hokkaido octopus, marinated bonito, and snapper are a treat, dressed not only with freshly ground wasabi root and top-notch soy sauce, but also the chef's signature chimichurri-a touch of fusion that signals his decade-plus years of working at Nobu.

The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated.

The menu layout and pricing can be a little bewildering at first but what becomes abundantly clear is that this is a well-orchestrated kitchen and one which demonstrates considerable skill and plenty of genuine care. Fish fin crudo is a great way to start; pasta dishes are surprisingly robust and generously proportioned; and entrées such as lamb with figs come with an awareness of contemporary tastes.

One large and plump potato raviolo, filled with creamy herb-flecked ricotta and floating in a pool of potato foam, is topped with a deep-fried sage leaf, which in turn makes for an ideal counterpoint to the rich layer beneath.

Parmesan and fried parsley leaves gild the romaine in a delicious, very garlicky Caesar salad; just as a coiled link of terrifically flavored merguez is perfectly finished with smoky Marcona almond aïoli.

A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this brunch-focused bijou has achieved such success in NY that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Service can struggle to keep up with the crowds, but the loud and lively dining room doesn't seem to notice. Breakfast for dinner is always a treat, especially when golden brown Belgian waffles are served with warm maple butter and topped with buttermilk-brined fried chicken for a flawless marriage of sweet and savory.

Two suggestions to novices: dine during off-hours to avoid their mile-long line; and ponder exactly how firm you like your ramen cooked and rich you like your broth before even stepping afoot. The décor may not say much, but the food speaks volumes in terms of authenticity and flavor. Start with steamed buns of succulent pork or pan-fried gyoza, before moving on to enticing mains centered around unbeatable renditions of ramen. Kuro ramen features an intensely nourishing and garlicky tonkotsu broth bobbing with bits of char siu.

Tulsi, Indian,"Anyone who loves their Indian food but got jaded by the generic ghee-heavy menus of Curry Hill should head along to Tulsi. In place of the seizure-inducing colored lighting, this midtown favorite offers billowing muslin and neutral tones; and instead of the usual Bollywood clichés, it provides tranquil, sophisticated surroundings, and attentive, sweet natured service. The menu is also markedly different from the norm. For the appetizers, the kitchen takes the sort of snacks you can find streetside on Chaupati and, by putting its own spin on them (and using primary ingredients), raises them to new heights-such as with the white beans of ragda chaat, which is a great way to start your meal. You can also go Goan for some Portuguese influence with the succulent shrimp balchao. But, be sure to leave room for authentic goat biryani served on the bone, or something from the tandoor like those tender lamb chops. As a nod to local tastes, spicing can be a little timid but those who are familiar with India-and anyone who knows their silly mid-on from their backward point-will still find much to savor.",10017,40.75327,-73.97177,37.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The modern pub menu covers all the bases with panache. The griddled Bash burger, slathered with house-made caramelized onion and bacon jam crowned with two crisp onion rings, is a memorable affair.

The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele did not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain.

Don't come expecting the culinary pyrotechnics of Eleven Madison Park: here it's about familiar flavors in more approachable, less intricate dishes, but with the same care and understanding of ingredients. Chicken-which, if we're honest, would be the final meal of choice of many of us-is the undoubted star; they roast a whole bird, pimp it up with foie gras and black truffle and serve it for two. Bone marrow adds depth to beef, while asparagus with bread sauce shows the kitchen is equally adept when subtlety is required.

There may be no more genuine expression of this kitchen than the farm eggs, their yolk bright orange and fresh, set beside gently charred slices of hangar steak and fork-tender fingerlings.

After those buttery biscuits, a decadent meal might continue with rich seven cheese macaroni, topped with crumbled bacon and parsley.

It's possible to feast on starters alone like ladolemono-dressed grilled octopus with fava bean purée, or papoutsakia (stuffed eggplant topped with caramelized béchamel sauce).

If the ambience alone doesn't transport you to the Medi, your first bite most certainly will. The meze is a parade led by marinated olives, pantzaria, tzatziki, taramasalata, and hummus, which may be followed by morsels of meat from keftedes to koupepia.

While the latter is a fuller experience working in an abundance of flavors like pan-seared squab breast, the tasting is a slightly streamlined and more rewarding choice.

Food voyeurs should vie for a seat at the bar, where they can eye fresh seafood lined up in plump, shimmering rows or enjoy the action behind the glass wall of the semi-open kitchen. Otherwise, a seat in the bustling dining room, decked out in gorgeous Portuguese tiles and hip lobster-trap lights, ought to do the trick.Try the espargos assados, a dish of tender, spit-grilled spring asparagus topped with shaved dried sea urchin, sorrel, olive oil and a dust of sea salt; or the wickedly good frango piri-piri, grilled to perfection and served with its mouthwatering namesake pepper sauce.",10001,40.746777,-73.989975,37.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Regulars perch at the bar to watch the 'tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with potato crisps.

Bypass the first floor and find a roost on the second level, where warm, almost maternal servers with a sense of humor present an array of fragrant grilled meats. The haemool pa jeon is a flaky seafood pancake and excellent starter that may be trailed by delicate slices of galbi sizzling on the grill.

Locally grown produce and domestic fish are the foundation of the high-quality ichiju sansei, a set lunch of shioyaki (salt-grilled) or miso-marinated broiled fish, rice, miso soup, and shira-ae (wilted greens with a tofu dressing).

It's a moot point as to whether this is a bar with a bistro attached or a bistro with a great bar; even those running it can't decide because the volume of the music goes up and down like a fiddler's elbow.In the meantime, the kitchen keeps things fairly simple and does them well enough.

A pot de fromage sets the tone for the meal. This luscious parmesan custard, served with toast points slathered in anchovy butter, is simple, satisfying with just the right amount of richness. At lunch, a steak sandwich with aged Gruyère and bacon marmalade on a Balthazar-baked brioche bun is a hit.
