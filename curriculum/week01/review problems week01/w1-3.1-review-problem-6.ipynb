    "### Review problem 6 (hard)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem you will be defining a function that calculates the **spearman correlation coefficient** between two lists. The spearman correlation is a measure of how related two sets of numbers are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept two provided lists of numbers, ```X``` and ```Y```\n",
    "- Print the length of ```X``` and ```Y``` using the ```len()``` function, like so:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    Length of X: 40\n",
    "    Length of Y: 40\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Calculate the **rank** of the numbers in the ```X``` and ```Y``` lists. The **rank** is a number that defines what index position each number would be if the list were in order.\n",
    "    - For example: say ```list1 = [5,2,0,9,-5]```, then ```list1_rank = [3,2,1,4,0]```\n",
    "    - Calculating the rank is not trivial. You can use the ```rankdata()``` function from ```scipy.stats``` on a list to get the ranks of the numbers.\n",
    "    - Assign the rank of list ```X``` to ```X_rank``` and list ```Y``` to ```Y_rank```\n",
    "- Calculate the **covariance between ```X_rank``` and ```Y_rank```** as ```XY_rank_cov```:\n",
    "    - The **covariance** is a measure of the \"relatedness\" between two lists of variables.\n",
    "    - To calculate the covariance between these two lists:\n",
    "        1. Calculate ```X_mean```: the mean of ```X_rank``` using ```np.mean()```\n",
    "        2. Calculate ```Y_mean```: the mean of ```Y_rank``` using ```np.mean()```\n",
    "        3. Calculate ```X_deviation```: subtract ```X_mean``` from each element of ```X_rank```\n",
    "        4. Calculate ```Y_deviation```: subtract ```Y_mean``` from each element of ```Y_rank```\n",
    "        5. Calculate ```XY_d```: multiply ```X_deviation``` with ```Y_deviation```, **element by element**. You can use pythons ```zip()``` function to iterate across lists at the same time:\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "            for xd, yd in zip(X_deviation, Y_deviation):\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        6. Calculate ```sum_XY_d```: the sum of the elements in ```XY_d``` with ```np.sum()```\n",
    "        7. Calculate ```XY_rank_cov```: divide ```sum_XY_d``` by ```len(XY_d)```\n",
    "- Calculate the standard deviations ```X_rank_std``` and ```Y_rank_std``` of the ```X_rank``` and ```Y_rank``` lists using ```np.std()```\n",
    "- Calculate the **spearman rank correlation coefficient** as ```XY_spearman```: divide ```XY_rank_cov``` by ```(X_rank_std * Y_rank_std)```\n",
    "- Print ```XY_spearman```\n",
    "- Compare your value to the scipy function for spearman: print out ```spearmanr(X, Y)```"
